This latter measurement has a value of 1 for trunks with a diameter of less than 120 mm, 
2 for trunks with diameter greater than 120 mm, and −9999 for trunks with unknown diameters.
 The value of 120 mm represents the common minimum threshold adopted by the NFIs, 
although single NFIs have different minimum thresholds, ranging from 0 mm in Finland to 120 mm in Cyprus and Switzerland54.
 The choice of threshold has important implications, since estimations of biomass based on different thresholds can deliver very different results
